                <p style="font-family:Helvetica;">
                For most people, "Just be a nice person," seems like an easily attainable goal. Yet is a distinguish gap between simply helping someone, an act of kindness and true love of beeing generous. Many people regard generosity as an obligation, a kind of need as human beeing. Sometimes they would feel relief if the charity collector happens to bypass their door. It's true that they would give if asked, and the action would be deemed a genorosity, yet their attitude falls far short of the ideal.

                With the goal of helping every one  develop a positive mindset toward real generosity, realizing its importance in human relationships.

                Beeing generous and kind - doing is no less than an emulation of G-dly compassion, It links all the world and underlies the relationship with all Creation.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica;"><strong><em>How can we make this effectively?</em></strong></h3>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">
  The big change is to be willing to help others.
  But how to help? What can I do for someone else?
